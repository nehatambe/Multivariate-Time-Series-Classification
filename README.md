# TimeSeriesClassification

This project implements the code to classify the multivariate time series data generated from sensors using shape mining approach. The code extends the Fast Shapelet Discovery shapelet extraction algorithm to extract the shapelets from multivariate time series data and build a decision tree classifier using extracted shapelets to classify the time series.
